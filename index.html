                        <aside class="notes">
                            Hi everyone.<br>
                            I would like to talk with you about writing faster code. Last time I gave a short talk on how to make your Python code faster, I remember someone pointing out that 'basically you can rewrite your code in C to make it faster'.<br>
                            And you know what ? The guy was absolutely right. Take any piece of Python code, rewrite it in C or C++ and it will probably be faster.<br>
                            So I was thinking, "Hmm, if I say just 'writing faster code', people will be confused if it's only about Python or not".<br>
                            So I decided to fix it.<br>

                            I was very happy with the new title. It makes it clear that we are not gonna talk about Java or C today.<br>
                            But then I realized that this title is too long, I mean even though it's very clear, it barely even fits on the slide.<br>
                            So I had to change it again.<br>

                            Python was not created to be a fast language that you would use for some computations where every nanosecond counts.<br>

                            Python is very easy to learn. The fact that it's so easy to read and write code in Python is very encouraging for people new to software development.<br>
                            I see that it's getting more and more popular in schools or at the universities as the first programming language.<br>

                            Nope, there are many big companies that are quite happy with using Python as their backend or parts of their backend.<br>
                            Those are companies with millions of users and billions of requests per month, so I think your website will also be fine with Python.

                            So Python is usually fast enough. But what if we decide it's not fast enough anymore.<br>
                            For example, your website starts giving timeouts to your users or maybe a faster code will bring more money for your company.<br>
                            It's time for optimization!

                            But how do you optimize your code ?<br>
                            Probably you need to follow some rules, so let's try to google that.<br>
                            And let's open the first link.<br>

                            Only 3 rules ? Wow, optimization might be easier than we expected!<br>

                        </ul>
                        <aside class="notes">
                            First rule of optimization: Don't. Ok, that was easy. Thanks for listening, any questions ?<br>
                            Well, actually no, there is more to that.<br>
                            So what does it mean 'Don't' ?<br>
                            Well, 9 out of 10 times when you think you need optimization, you don't, especially in the early stage of your product's life.<br>
                            You might think it would be nice to optimize your code a bit, but first of all, you will waste time doing something that is probably not needed.<br>
                            If you want your code to run faster, you can start with getting faster hardware in the first place.<br>
                            Second of all, optimization comes with a cost. Most often the only cost is the time you spend optimizing the existing code.<br>
                            Sometimes, it's also the time needed to fix what you just broke with your optimization.<br>
                            But also, the optimized code might not be as readable as it was in the first place.<br>
                            And maybe your code is now running faster but it uses more memory ?<br>
                            So unless you have really good reasons to optimize - don't do this.<br>
                            If you know that you really need to optimize, then you can move to the second rule of optimization<br>
                            ###CLICK###<br>
                            Don't do this yet.<br>
                            This is how I understand this rule:<br>
                            ###CLICK###<br>
                            First make sure your code works<br>
                            Then make sure you have a good test suite<br>
                            And only then, you are ready for optimization.<br>
                            I love this rule, it always reminds me how many times I broke it.<br>
                            I mean, so many times I was in the middle of working on something and then I started thinking: "Hmm, I can change that piece of code and probably it will be faster - also I will save 2 lines of code".<br>
                            Was it a good idea ?<br>
                            Nope. And not only because I ended up breaking things. Well, quite often I did end up breaking things, but also, when I started jumping around the code, I forgot what I was writing in the first place.<br>
                            Did it make my code faster ?<br>
                            I have no idea, because I had nothing to compare it to! If I had written the whole function first and then improve it, I could measure it and see if it's now better or worse, but otherwise I can only guess.<br>
                            And that brings me to the last rules of optimization - Don't guess.<br>
                            ###CLICK###<br>
                            Always profile your code before optimization. Human are terrible in predicting bottlenecks of the code.<br>
                            If your code is slow - profile it and see what takes most of the time.<br>
                            Otherwise, you might end up spending time to rewrite part of your code just to make it 1% faster, while there are other parts of the system where you can gain much more improvements with less effort.<br>
                            ###CLICK###<br>
                            There are plenty of profiling tools.<br>
                            If you don't know where to start, you can try the built-in Python profiler called cProfile.<br>
                            It will show you a clear overview of how many times each function is called and where your code is spending most of the time.<br>
                            You can combine it with the pstats module, which allows for more advanced formatting of the results.<br>
                            If you prefer a graphical interface, you can take a look at libraries like RunSnakeRun and SnakeViz.

                        <aside class="notes">
                            Once we are ready for optimization, we have to decide, on which area we want to focus.<br>
                            There are different levels of optimization:<br>
                            ###CLICK###<br>
                            Starting from the highest level, you have the design level optimization. Depending on the constrains and priorities of your system, you can optimize it by redesigning it. It might require rewriting parts or the whole application in a different programming language, changing the type of a database or redesigning the architecture of your software to limit the number of DB queries.<br>
                            This type of optimization can give you the best improvement, but also takes the most time to do this.<br>
                            I don't encourage you to rewrite your software from the scratch, but if you have some critical parts of the code that are run often, you can optimize them by rewriting it in C or C++. Because C is faster, you can get some good speed improvement for free. Well, not really for free - now you have to maintain Python AND C/C++ code in one project.<br>
                            ###CLICK###<br>
                            One level lower, we have algorithms and data structures. That is usually the second biggest improvement you can get after a complete redesign. Knowing different algorithms together with their complexity definitely helps creating good and fast software.

                            For example, if you want to get the sum of numbers from 1 to N, the first idea might be a loop that goes though all elements and adds them.<br>
                            It will work, but it won't be fast.<br>

                            You can instead use an algorithm for the arithmetic sum, which will give you the same results and it will be more efficient.

                            Next level is the source code optimization.<br>
                            This is something that I will talk about more in the second part of the presentation.<br>
                            ###CLICK###<br>
                            Now we are moving to the low levels of optimization.<br>
                            For example, "build level" involves setting up specific build flags.<br>
                            In you daily work, it's not something that you do often.<br>
                            You can optimize Python for a specific architecture, but if you are a web-developer like me, you will probably do this only once for each machine or you won't bother at all.<br>
                            ###CLICK###<br>
                            Next, the compile level.<br>
                            You can make some optimizations if your programming language is using an Ahead of Time compiler.<br>
                            Since, I'm talking about the CPython, that doesn't have an Ahead of Time compiler, we skip this part as well.<br>
                            ###CLICK###<br>
                            Last but not least - runtime level.<br>
                            It's related with a specific compiler you are using.<br>
                            Some compilers are faster than the others, for example if you replace CPython with PyPy, in some specific cases you can gain on average up to 7 times speed improvement, but again, it depends on what kind of tasks you are doing.<br>
                            Most of the time, once we set up on a specific language implementation, there is nothing we have to do to benefit from this kind of optimization - it's up to the creators of the compilers to optimize them, so simply updating to the new version of the programming language can make your code run a bit faster.

                            And less disk space, perform less disk operations, network operations, use less power, etc. etc.<br>
                            The bad news is - you can't have all of this.<br>
                            Optimization in one area will usually cause deterioration in other areas.<br>
                            You always have to decide, which resources are crucial to you and try to optimize in that direction.<br>
                            So it's possible that optimization will have nothing to do with the execution time at all, as there can be other resources more important than the raw speed.<br>
                            For example, who cares if your program is now 10 times faster if it's crashing half of the time, because it's running out of memory ?

                            For measuring execution time of code, I will use the magic %timeit function.<br>
                            It has some overhead comparing with the standard timeit library, but it doesn't really matter - as long as we use the same method to measure execution time of different functions, we only need to know which method is faster and by how much.<br>
                            So for each of my examples, I write different versions of code, measure the execution time and compare them.

                            Let's start with something simple. Let's say you want to count the number of elements in a list.<br>
                            You can easily write a simple loop that increments a counter and, while this will work, it will be very slow.<br>
                            You can achieve the same results by simply calling the built-in function len().<br>
                            And as you can see even for only 1 million elements, the speed difference is insanely huge.<br>
                            So, my first advice is to not reinvent the wheel, but first check if there is a function that you can use.

                            Also, before you start writing your own version of ordered dictionary or dictionary with default values, take a look at the collections module from the standard library.<br>
                            Even though it contains only like 10 different datatypes, they are probably THE datatypes you are looking for when the standard ones are not enough.

                        Let's say you have a list of 1 million numbers and you want to select only the odd numbers.<br>
                        The naive version would be to use a for loop, so for each element of the list you check if it's odd and if it is, the you add it to another list.<br>
                        But I already showed you in the previous example that in most cases, for loops can be replaced with something better.<br>
                        ###CLICK###<br>
                        In this case, you could use the built-in filter function instead.<br>
                        In Python 2, filter was returning a list directly.<br>
                        In Python 3, it's returning an iterator, so I need to call the list function on that iterator to get the same results as in case of the loop.<br>
                        Even though calling list function has some impact on the performance, it's negligible comparing to the time spent in the filter function.<br>
                        But as we can see, filter performs even slower than the for loop.<br>
                        Why does this happen ?<br>
                        Well, the fact that filter is now returning an iterator is a clear suggestion that this is a wrong use case for the filter function.<br>
                        ###CLICK###<br>
                        If we want to get the whole list as a result, the better idea is to use list comprehension.<br>
                        It's around 75% faster than the for loop and - at least for me - it looks very clear.

                        But what if you need to iterate over a list and also get the index of each element ?<br>
                        Let's say, you want to take a list and convert it to a dictionary, in such way that index of each element becomes a key of that dictionary, and the value in the list becomes the value in the dictionary.<br>
                        There is a bad was to do this, where you basically iterate over the numbers from 0 to 1 million and take the value corresponding to that number in the list.<br>
                        A better idea would be to use the enumerate function to get the list elements together with the index.<br>
                        And this is going to be faster by 50%.<br>
                        But it's still a for loop with only one instruction inside, so it can easily be replaced with dictionary comprehension.<br>
                        The speed performance will be the same, but the code will be shorter and easier to read.

                            When you want to execute a piece of code, but you are not sure it will be successful (maybe some variables are not set or like here, the class might not have a specific attribute), so you want to protect yourself somehow.<br>
                            The first way you can do this is called 'Look before you leap' or 'Ask for permission'.<br>
                            What is means is that you first check if the class has a specific attribute and then you perform the operations.<br>
                            Usually this checking is done with the if statement.<br>
                            However, there is a different approach that you could use - it's called "Beg for forgiveness".<br>
                            In this scenario, you perform your operations without checking the conditions, but in case you expect that something might break, you wrap you code in a try/except block and catch the exceptions that were raised.<br>
                            As you can see in this simple example, begging for forgiveness is 3 times faster.

                            Here, we are checking if 3 attributes are available.<br>
                            Asking for permissions is still slower and now it also gets more difficult to read.<br>
                            Following the beg for forgiveness approach will result in faster and more readable code.<br>
                            So, we could say that asking for forgiveness instead of checking the permissions as always a better choice.

                            But we won't say that, because it's not true.<br>
                            Exceptions handling is still quite expensive.<br>
                            If the object doesn't have the attribute we are looking for, begging for forgiveness will be slower than asking for permissions.<br>
                            So as a rule of thumb, you can use the 'Ask for permissions' way if you know that it's very likely that the attribute will be missing or there will be some other problems that you can predict.<br>
                            Otherwise, if you are expecting that your code will work fine for most of the time, using try/except will be faster and quite often more readable way to go.<br>
                            For example, you are fetching some files from the internet and you are expecting that it will work, unless there is no internet connection, then instead of checking if there is network connection, if it's fast enough, no timeouts, etc. just go for try/except.<br>
                            But again, I strongly advise you to measure both solutions to see which one is faster in your scenario.

                            Let's tackle another problem - membership testing.<br>
                            If you have a list and want to check if it contains a specific element, you can use a for loop.<br>
                            But the problem is, you are iterating over the list, event though you are not really doing anything with all the elements.<br>

                            You can replace the for loop with the in statement.<br>
                            It will check if a specific element belongs to given set of data.<br>
                            And it will do this twice as fast.<br>
                            Ok, but there is still one big problem with this approach.<br>

                        If you want to perform the same operation on a large set of data, you have two options.<br>
                        You can write a function that performs the operation and then call this function 1000 time.<br>
                        Or, you can write a function that takes those 1000 elements and performs the operation inside.<br>
                        And the second approach will be faster, so if you can easily change your code and replace multiple calls to a function with one function, then probably it's a good idea.

                            You can explicitly compare this variable to True, but in most cases, it's adding unnecessary redundancy.<br>
                            You can simplify your condition to just 'if variable'.<br>
                            It will return True, unless the variable is False, None, 0, empty string, empty list or any other "Falsy" expression.<br>
                            And by doing that, your comparison gets faster by 70%.

                            Let's take a look at different ways of defining functions in Python.<br>
                            The most common way to create a function is with def keyword.<br>
                            The other way is to declare an anonymous function with lambda.<br>
                            If you assign this lambda to a variable it will act in the same way as function created with def keyword.<br>
                            And as you can see, they are both equally fast.<br>
                            Why ? Because both version do exactly the same thing.

                        <aside class="notes">
                            We can disassemble the code of both versions with the dis library and we will see that inside, it's the same code.<br>
                            So is there any difference ?<br>
                            Well, if your function has more than one line, then you can't use lambda.<br>
                            Also, you can't really put documentation inside lambda function.<br>
                            And if you have PEP-8 enabled in you code editor, it will complain each time you try to assign lambda to a variable.<br>
                            And he is right, lambda works really nice when you need a simple one-liner callback for functions, especially for functions like filter, map or reduce.<br>
                            There are also some quite narrow use cases when it might be necessary to use the lambda as a callback - if you want to read more, you can check the link at the bottom of this slide.<br>
                            However, for any other case, I would use def. It's much cleaner, you can document it properly and the performance is the same.<br>

                            It's faster, because if you call a function, Python needs to resolve this function first.<br>
                            With the literal syntax, there is no overhead for that.

                        If you have a bunch of variables that you need to assign, you can either do this the normal, sequential way or you can go for this crazy parallel assignment.<br>

                        Another interesting property of Python - the lookup for local variables is faster than the lookup for globals or built-ins.<br>
                        So you can save some time if, for example, you store the reference to a built-in function or a global function in a local variable.<br>
                        In this example, the only difference is that on line 3, I'm storing the reference to the append function in a variable called append.<br>
                        Thanks to that, this function is 35% faster, but then again, if you see this code for the first time, it's not obvious what it is supposed to do.<br>
                        It might be confusing to see this append function, as we are used to see the list.append version more often.

                        To sum up - there are different kinds of optimization, it's quite often about the speed, but not always.<br>
                        There are different levels of optimization, sometimes if you can't rewrite your whole application, maybe you can use a different approach?<br>
                        Even though the source code optimization might not be the fastest way to optimize your code, those small improvements will add up.<br>
                        And the main advantage of it, is that it's cheap.<br>
                        You don't need to make huge changes, you can optimize your code at the moment of writing.<br>
                        If you write idiomatic code and don't reinvent the wheel but use the existing functions and data structures, then you are already good.<br>
                        So be curious when your are coding.<br>
                        If you think that a different code structure will be faster, you can quickly check it with timeit and improve it.

                        All right, my name is Sebastian Witowski, I work at CERN so if you want to talk with my about physics, then you are probably on a wrong conference.<br>
                        But if you want to talk about Python, you can catch me somewhere on that corridor.<br>
